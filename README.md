STATUS: ALPHA - not well tested



Don't be confused about the double notification in this video. This is because I bought and sold to myself.

Short Description:
With this plugin, players can sell or buy any item on a free market, by create a sell- or buyorder. The price of each item will be determined by supply and demand. I developed this plugin for myself, but If someone will find it usefull, I will keep developing and updating.

Usage: (autocompletion in console)
/ix help

/ix gui | Graphical User Interface (*create limit orders)

/ix price | prints the current buy and sell orders
/ix price <itemid> | prints the current buy and sell orders

/ix buy | buy what is in right hand on best price (existing sellorder needed)
/ix sell | sell what is in right hand on best price (existing buyorder needed)

/ix buy <itemname> <amount> <limit | market> <price> | create buy order
/ix sell <itemname> <amount> <limit | market> <price> | create sell order

/ix withdraw list | list all your available payouts
/ix withdraw <itemname> <amount> | withdraw

/ix order list <buyorders | sellorders> *<itemid> | * optional
/ix order close <buyorders | sellorders> <order id> | close an existing order

# Roadmap: (priority in order) #

- Order commands (DONE)

- Admin Function
A admin shop function creates automatically a buy and sell order for every item. If someone buys an item from the admin order, the price will increase and update the admin order. Also If a seller sells an item, the price will decrease.

- Broker may want to charge trading fees
I am going to add a variable in the config file, in that you can write the percentage of the trading fees.

- GUI (DONE)

- Signs
Easy use /ix buy and /ix sell by clicking right or left on a sign. If there are a lot of signs on a server could be difficult to update prices. Not sure, I have also to investigate.

- Plugin folder (DONE)

- WEBUI (my favorite but a lot of work)
- This idea will be implemented after the basic plugin is stable -
Imagine you have a webfront for trading with charts and everything you need, similar to a cryptocurrency exchange. I can add to each item a icon for better user experience. And you can also trade on your smartphone without being in the game. I want to build that after, the plugin is heavly tested. Please support my project and test the plugin!
