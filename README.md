# Itemex
With this Minecraft Spigot Server Plugin, players can sell or buy any item on a free market, by create a sell- or buyorder. The price of each item will be determined by supply and demand. I developed this plugin for myself, but If someone will find it usefull, I will keep developing and updating.
